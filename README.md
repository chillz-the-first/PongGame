🏓 Pong Game
A Python implementation of the classic Pong arcade game using the Turtle graphics module.
This project is part of my journey to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python
and game development fundamentals.

Game Features
*Two-player Pong game built with Turtle graphics

*Paddle controls for both players:

Player A (Left Paddle): W (up), S (down)
Player B (Right Paddle): Up Arrow (up), Down Arrow (down)

*Ball bounces off paddles and walls

*Scoreboard keeps track of each player’s score

*Ball resets to the center after a point is scored

🕹 Controls

Left Paddle: W (up), S (down)

Right Paddle: Up Arrow (up), Down Arrow (down)

⚙ Setup & Run

Clone or download the repository.

Open main.py in PyCharm or any Python IDE.

Run the script:

python main.py


Have fun playing!

📂 File Structure

main.py — Game loop and screen setup

paddle.py — Paddle class and movement logic

ball.py — Ball class and movement logic

scoreboard.py — Score tracking and display

💡 Notes

The game uses Turtle graphics, so it runs in a windowed GUI.

Paddle and ball collisions are calculated based on their positions and sizes.

You can adjust screen size, paddle size, and ball speed in the code.
